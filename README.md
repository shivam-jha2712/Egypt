## FAQ

#### Languages Used

Html, CSS 

### What problems I am having with this ?

I want this website to have that learnmore section not visible till the time it is not hover or targeted. That should be below the Land of Phorahs section.

Sound is also one of the issues which I am facing. I wish to trigger an auto enable sound loop that would autoplay when the website is clicked.
